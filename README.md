A small project with some benchmarks for Oboe.js

To run on Node:

```bash
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

To run in the browser:

```bash
bower install

# Now serve index.html to browser. In this example, we'll use http-server and Node.
# If you have Apache or something locally go ahead and use that instead

$ sudo npm install -g http-server
$ http-server

# open browser at http://localhost:8080/index.html
```
